The infrastructure is distributed across multiple servers for improved reliability.

Load Balancer (HAProxy): Distributes traffic across multiple web servers using a round-robin algorithm.
Web Servers (Nginx): Serve static files and handle requests.
Application Servers: Handle dynamic content and process business logic.
Database Cluster (Primary-Replica MySQL):
Primary Node: Handles write operations.
Replica Node: Handles read operations to reduce load on the primary server.
Issues:

Single Point of Failure: The load balancer is a single point of failure.
Security Gaps: No firewalls or encryption are in place.
No Monitoring: Failures could go undetected.
