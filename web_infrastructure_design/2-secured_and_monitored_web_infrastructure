The infrastructure adds security and monitoring features for better protection and visibility.

Firewalls: Implemented at each layer (Load Balancer, Web Servers, Database Servers) to filter unauthorized traffic.
SSL Certificate: Encrypts data exchanged between the client and the web servers (HTTPS).
Monitoring Clients (Sumologic): Collect performance metrics and error logs from all servers for proactive monitoring.
Issues:

SSL Termination Risk: SSL encryption stops at the load balancer, leaving internal traffic unencrypted.
Primary MySQL Limitation: Only one primary server can handle write operations, limiting redundancy.
Identical Server Configuration: All servers hosting the same components can cause inefficiencies.
