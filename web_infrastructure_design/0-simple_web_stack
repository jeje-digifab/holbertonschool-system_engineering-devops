A single server hosts the entire web infrastructure.

Web Server (Nginx): Manages incoming HTTP requests and serves static files.
Application Server: Executes the business logic and dynamic content generation.
Database (MySQL): Stores the data, including users, meals, and reservations.
Domain Name (foobar.com): The domain name resolves to the server IP address using a DNS A record.
Issues:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server fails, the entire site goes offline.
Maintenance Downtime: Server restarts during updates cause downtime.
Limited Scalability: The single server cannot handle high traffic effectively.
