The infrastructure now fully separates components and improves scalability.

Two Load Balancers (HAProxy Cluster): Active-Active setup ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
Web Servers: Dedicated servers handling static files and user requests.
Application Servers: Dedicated servers for processing dynamic requests and business logic.
Database Servers: Fully dedicated for data storage and replication.
Issues:

Data Consistency: Replication delays could affect data synchronization.
Higher Complexity: Managing multiple servers and clusters requires advanced skills.
Increased Cost: More components mean higher infrastructure costs.
